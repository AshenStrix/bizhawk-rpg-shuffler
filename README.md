# Bizhawk Shuffler 2
* written by authorblues, inspired by [Brossentia's Bizhawk Shuffler](https://github.com/brossentia/BizHawk-Shuffler), based on slowbeef's original project
* [tested on Bizhawk v2.6.2](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/releases/tag/2.6.2)  
  **Important:** BizHawk v2.6.3 is currently not supported

* **This branch exists to work on a Battletoads damage shuffler, a mod of the excellent work by authorblues and kalimag on the Mega Man damage shuffler.** This Battletoads "Chaos Shuffler" plugin is still very much in bug testing! MANY new games, beyond Battletoads, are supported or in testing - please check out the plugin's instructions for a list. Current features include support for shuffling in two-player mode, and for the various Battletoads games, level select based on file name, options for infinite lives, and other cheats. The plan will be for some of these non-Battletoads games to be broken out into their own plugin(s). Progress will be slow - I am a novice at best, and I would be hopeless without the existing work of authorblues and kalimag on MMDS!
