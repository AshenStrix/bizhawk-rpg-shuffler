# Bizhawk Shuffler 2
* written by authorblues, inspired by [Brossentia's Bizhawk Shuffler](https://github.com/brossentia/BizHawk-Shuffler), based on slowbeef's original project
* [tested on Bizhawk v2.6.3-v2.9.1](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/releases/)  
* [click here to download the latest version](https://github.com/authorblues/bizhawk-shuffler-2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* **This branch exists to work on a mod of the excellent work by authorblues and kalimag on the Mega Man damage shuffler.** The **"Chaos Shuffler"** plugin started with Battletoads (NES) only, and now it supports MANY more games - please check out the plugin's instructions for a full list. Some highlights are several Battletoads games, Mario games, Super Mario Kart, F-Zero, classic Castlevanias, and some "wait, this shuffles?" nonsense like Anticipation (NES), Family Feud (SNES), and Monopoly (NES). Features include support for multiplayer shuffling, infinite lives, ability to run simultaneously with MMDS, and for the various Battletoads games, level select based on file name and other cheats. Progress will be slow - I am a novice at best, and I would be hopeless without the existing, extremely cool work of authorblues and kalimag on MMDS!
* **TO PRIOR CHAOS SHUFFLER USERS - you need BOTH [the latest plugin](https://github.com/Phiggle/bizhawk-shuffler-2/blob/battletoads-shuffler-plugin/plugins/chaos-damage-shuffler.lua) AND [its hash database](https://github.com/Phiggle/bizhawk-shuffler-2/blob/battletoads-shuffler-plugin/plugins/chaos-shuffler-hashes.dat) now!!**
* Did I mention I am a novice? I am very grateful for reports of any bugs or general mistakes/bad ideas!
