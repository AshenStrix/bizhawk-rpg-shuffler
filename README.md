  **Important:** BizHawk v2.6.3 is currently not supported

* **This branch exists to work on a Battletoads damage shuffler, a mod of the excellent work by authorblues and kalimag on the Mega Man damage shuffler.** The plugin is still very much in bug testing! Current features for Battletoads NES include support for shuffling in two-player mode, level select based on file name, and options for infinite lives and other cheats. Progress will be slow - I am a novice at best. Please credit their work if you choose to try this plugin in the meantime.
