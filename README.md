# Bizhawk Shuffler 2
* written by authorblues, inspired by [Brossentia's Bizhawk Shuffler](https://github.com/brossentia/BizHawk-Shuffler), based on slowbeef's original project
* [tested on Bizhawk v2.6.3-v2.9.1](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/releases/)  
* [click here to download the latest version](https://github.com/authorblues/bizhawk-shuffler-2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

* **TO PRIOR CHAOS SHUFFLER USERS - you need BOTH the latest plugin and its hash now!**
* First, follow all of the setup instructions below by authorblues.
* Then, download the plugin and hash for the Chaos Shuffler and throw them in your plugins folder.
* **For the Main Chaos Damage Shuffler branch**: [plugin](https://github.com/Phiggle/bizhawk-shuffler-2/blob/main/plugins/chaos-damage-shuffler.lua), [hash database](https://github.com/Phiggle/bizhawk-shuffler-2/blob/main/plugins/chaos-shuffler-hashes.dat)
* **For the TESTING branch**: [plugin](https://github.com/Phiggle/bizhawk-shuffler-2/blob/battletoads-shuffler-plugin/plugins/chaos-damage-shuffler.lua), [hash database](https://github.com/Phiggle/bizhawk-shuffler-2/blob/battletoads-shuffler-plugin/plugins/chaos-shuffler-hashes.dat)

* **This branch exists to work on a mod of the excellent work by authorblues and kalimag on the Mega Man damage shuffler.** The **"Chaos Damage Shuffler"** plugin started with Battletoads (NES) only, and now it supports MANY more games - please check out the plugin's instructions for a full list. Some highlights are several games from the Battletoads, Mario, Metroid, Legend of Zelda, and Castlevania series, as well as Super Mario Kart, F-Zero, and some "wait, this shuffles?" nonsense like Anticipation (NES), Family Feud (SNES), and Monopoly (NES). Features include support for multiplayer shuffling, infinite lives, ability to run simultaneously with MMDS, and for the various Battletoads games, level select based on file name and other cheats.
* **TO THOSE PLAYING N64 GAMES: REMEMBER TO ENABLE THE EXPANSION PAK!**
* Did I mention I am a novice and do this on a pretty sporadic basis? I am very grateful for reports of any bugs or general mistakes/bad ideas! I would be hopeless without the existing, extremely cool work of authorblues and kalimag on MMDS. 
* Furthermore, a massive **thank you to Rogue_Millipede and Shadow Hog** is in order for their work on supporting shuffling for new games and vastly improving the plugin.
