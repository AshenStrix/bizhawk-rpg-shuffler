# Bizhawk Shuffler 2
* written by authorblues, inspired by [Brossentia's Bizhawk Shuffler](https://github.com/brossentia/BizHawk-Shuffler), based on slowbeef's original project
* [tested on Bizhawk v2.6.3-v2.9.1](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/releases/)  
* [click here to download the latest version](https://github.com/authorblues/bizhawk-shuffler-2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## Chaos Damage Shuffler: Basics
* Get shuffled when your character takes damage in a variety of games and senses. Click on the plugin link below for the full list!
* Game highlights: several games from the Battletoads, Mario, Metroid, Legend of Zelda, and Castlevania series, as well as Super Mario Kart, F-Zero, and some "wait, this shuffles?" nonsense like Anticipation (NES), Family Feud (SNES), Monopoly (NES), and much more.
* Infinite lives are generally supported.
* Multiplayer shuffling is generally supported.
* Randomizers should be supported (e.g., ALTTPR, VARIA, ZOoTR, SMZ3) by adding your game's hash to the .dat file alongside other versions of the game.
* The plugin can run simultaneously with the Mega Man Damage Shuffler.
* For Battletoads games, you can choose the level where you start and enable other bonuses, like choosing your start level (to shuffle many levels all together), skip Clinger-Winger, and more.

## Chaos Damage Shuffler: Thanks
* **This plugin is a mod of the excellent work by authorblues and kalimag on the Mega Man damage shuffler.** I'd have no idea what I was doing (well, moreso) without their work.
* A massive **thank you to Rogue_Millipede and Shadow Hog** is also in order for their work, adding shuffling for many new games and vastly improving the plugin. 
* Finally, thank you to Diabetus, Smight, and ConstantineDTW for extensive playthroughs that tracked down bugs.
* Did I mention I am a novice and do this on a pretty sporadic basis? I am very grateful for reports of any bugs or general mistakes/bad ideas!
